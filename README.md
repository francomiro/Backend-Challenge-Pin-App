# PinApp Backend - Challenge

## Description

This is an API created for the PinApp challenge, developed in Java with Spring Boot and deployed on an AWS EC2 instance with an Amazon RDS (MySQL) database.

## Tecnologies
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot**
- **MySQL**
- **Docker y Docker Compose**
- **AWS (EC2, RDS, ECR)**
- **Maven**
- **Hibernate**
- **Swagger**

## Configuration and Usage

### Option 1 - Run API with Docker in your computer

#### Required Software

- **Docker**: To create and run the necessary containers.

#### Deployment Instructions with Docker

#### 1. Clone the Repository

#### 2. Edit Configuration
Before starting the containers, configure the **Dockerfile** with this Database URL:

    ENV SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL jdbc:mysql://mysql:3306/

#### 3. Start the Containers with Docker Compose

Start the containers (both the database and the API) by running the following command:

    docker-compose up --build

The API will be accessible at the following URL:

    http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html


### Opci√≥n 2: Consume the API from the AWS Server

If you prefer to consume the API deployed on the AWS server, use one of the following URLs:

#### API URL

    http://3.145.110.34:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

    http://ec2-3-145-110-34.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

This URL allows you to access the API documentation generated with Swagger and test the different available endpoints.
